## `score lint`

Run content lint rules on text.

```bash
cd-agency score lint [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Short | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--input` | `-i` | string | Text to lint |
| `--file` | `-f` | path | Read from file |
| `--type` | `-t` | choice | Content type (see below) |
| `--prefer-consistency` | | flag | Relax character limits when consistency matters more than brevity |
| `--json-output` | | flag | Output as JSON |

**Content types:**

| Type | Rules Applied |
| --- | --- |
| `general` | Jargon, inclusive language, passive voice |
| `cta` | + CTA action verb, button character limit |
| `button` | + CTA action verb, button character limit |
| `error` | + Error actionable language |
| `notification` | + Notification character limit (120 chars) |
| `microcopy` | + Additional passive voice check |

**Lint rules:**

| Rule | Severity | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no-jargon` | warning | Flags buzzwords and corporate jargon |
| `inclusive-language` | error | Flags exclusionary terms (e.g., "whitelist" → "allowlist") |
| `no-passive-voice` | warning | Detects passive voice patterns |
| `cta-action-verb` | error | CTA must start with an action verb |
| `button-char-limit` | error | Button text must be ≤ 40 characters |
| `notification-char-limit` | error | Notification text must be ≤ 120 characters |
| `error-actionable` | error | Error messages must include resolution guidance |
| `consistent-terminology` | warning | Detects mixed terminology (e.g., "log in" + "login") |

**Example:**

```bash
cd-agency score lint -i "Click here to learn more!" --type button
```

```
[FAIL] cta-action-verb: CTA should start with an action verb, found 'click'
       -> Try starting with: claim, discover, explore, invite, learn, log, submit, take...
[PASS] button-char-limit: Button text is 25 chars (limit: 40)
```

**Consistency mode:**

When you have a set of parallel strings (e.g., menu items, button groups) where
consistency matters more than strict brevity, use `--prefer-consistency`. This
relaxes character limits by 20% and downgrades violations from error to info.

```bash
cd-agency score lint -i "Complete your purchase securely" --type button --prefer-consistency
```

```
[INFO] button-char-limit: Button text is 31 chars (soft limit: 40, consistency allowance: 48)
```
